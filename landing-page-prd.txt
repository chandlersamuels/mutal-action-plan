Create a modern, high-converting SaaS landing page for a Mutual Action Plan (MAP) tool designed to give sales teams and prospects shared visibility into every step of the deal cycle — eliminating unknowns and accelerating closes.

Target Audience

Primary: Sales managers and sales executives at B2B companies with long, complex sales cycles (30–120+ day deal cycles)
Secondary: Revenue operations leaders and CROs looking for pipeline predictability
Tone: Confident, direct, outcome-driven. Speak to the pain of deals going dark, stalled pipelines, and lack of buyer alignment. Avoid jargon-heavy or overly corporate language — be sharp and modern.


Design Requirements
Color & Style

Color palette: Bright/vibrant green as the primary accent, white and light gray backgrounds, dark text for contrast. Use green gradients sparingly for energy.
Design style: Glassmorphism — frosted glass cards, subtle transparency, soft blurred backgrounds, layered depth. Clean and premium feeling.
Animations: Smooth scroll-triggered animations (fade-ins, slide-ups, subtle parallax). Micro-interactions on buttons and cards (hover glows, gentle scaling). Animated hero section with a subtle particle or mesh gradient background.
Mobile-first & responsive: Must look excellent on mobile. Sticky CTA, thumb-friendly tap targets, sections that stack cleanly.
Conversion-optimized: Sticky header with CTA, multiple CTA touchpoints throughout the page, social proof near decision points, minimal friction.

CRITICAL: Anti-Generic Design Directive
This must NOT look like a typical AI-generated landing page. Avoid the following clichés at all costs:

Perfectly symmetrical 3-column card grids
Generic gradient blob backgrounds
Cookie-cutter "How It Works" 1-2-3 step layouts with circles and arrows
Uniform section padding with no visual rhythm variation
Safe, predictable layouts where every section is centered and evenly spaced

Instead, follow these creative principles:
Layout & Composition

Use asymmetric layouts — offset headings to the left while visuals float right, or vice versa. Let content breathe unevenly.
Vary section heights dramatically — a tall immersive hero, a compact metrics strip, a wide-open whitespace section, then a dense feature area. Create visual rhythm.
Use overlapping elements — let cards, images, or UI mockups break out of their sections and overlap into adjacent ones. Nothing should feel boxed in.
Implement a horizontal scroll showcase for at least one section (e.g., features or integrations) — break the vertical scroll monotony.
Use staggered/masonry-style grids instead of perfectly aligned columns.

Section Transitions

No hard cuts between sections. Use creative transitions such as:

Angled/diagonal dividers (CSS clip-path or SVG shapes) between sections
Organic wave or curved separators that feel fluid, not mechanical
Color bleeds where one section's background gradually shifts into the next
Parallax layering where background elements from one section remain visible as you scroll into the next


At least one section should use a reveal-on-scroll effect where content "unfolds" or "builds" as the user scrolls — not just fade in, but structurally assemble (e.g., timeline nodes connecting with animated lines, cards sliding in from different directions at staggered intervals)

Creative Components

Hero section: Don't just show a static mockup. Build an interactive or animated mini-demo — a stylized MAP timeline where tasks visually check off, progress bars animate, and avatars appear as if buyer and seller are collaborating in real time. Make it feel alive.
Metrics section: Instead of static number cards, use a scrollytelling counter where numbers rapidly count up as they enter the viewport, paired with a subtle background visual (like a pipeline funnel that fills or a deal timeline that accelerates).
Problem section: Instead of 3 icon cards, use a "before/after" split-screen or slider — left side shows the chaotic, no-visibility sales process (dark, cluttered, red accents), right side shows the MAP-enabled process (clean, green, organized). Let the user drag a divider or have it animate on scroll.
Features section: Use a tabbed or interactive showcase rather than a static grid — clicking/hovering each feature morphs a central mockup or illustration to show that feature in context. Or use a scroll-jacked feature spotlight where each feature gets its own mini-scene as you scroll.
Integrations section: Instead of a static logo row, show the logos orbiting or connected via animated node lines — like a living ecosystem diagram. Or have each logo on a glassmorphic floating card with subtle depth and hover parallax.
Testimonial section: Use an oversized pull-quote design with large serif typography, not a small card. Consider a slow auto-rotating carousel with a frosted glass background and subtle ken-burns movement on background elements.

Typography & Micro-Details

Use two contrasting typefaces — a bold, modern display/sans-serif for headlines (something with personality, not just Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans) and a clean readable font for body text.
Mix in one accent element that feels hand-crafted — a subtle hand-drawn arrow, an underline that looks like a marker stroke, or a highlight effect behind key words.
Use variable font weight animations on hover for nav items or key headlines.
Add cursor-reactive elements — subtle parallax on glassmorphic cards that tilt slightly toward the mouse, or a soft glow that follows the cursor in the hero section.

Motion & Animation Philosophy

Animations should feel physics-based and organic — use spring/elastic easing curves, not linear or basic ease-in-out. Elements should feel like they have weight.
Stagger everything — when multiple elements enter the viewport, they should cascade in sequence (50-100ms delays), never all appear at once.
Add at least one scroll-linked animation where an element's position, scale, rotation, or opacity is directly tied to scroll progress (not just triggered by scroll).
Subtle floating/breathing animations on background elements — gentle up-down oscillation on decorative shapes, slow rotation on gradient orbs.

Mobile-Specific Creativity

Don't just stack the desktop layout. Reimagine interactions for touch — horizontal scroll carousels instead of grids, swipeable before/after comparisons, tap-to-reveal feature cards.
Use full-bleed visuals on mobile that feel immersive, not cramped.
Keep the creative transitions (diagonal dividers, wave separators) but ensure they perform smoothly at 60fps on mobile.


Page Sections (in order)
1. Hero Section

Bold headline addressing the core pain point (deals stalling, lack of buyer-seller alignment, no visibility into what happens after the demo)
Subheadline reinforcing the solution — a shared action plan that keeps both sides accountable
Primary CTA button (e.g., "Start Closing Faster" or "Get Early Access") and a secondary ghost/outline CTA (e.g., "See How It Works")
Hero visual: an animated, interactive mini-demo of the MAP interface — a shared timeline or checklist between buyer and seller with tasks checking off, progress bars filling, and collaboration avatars appearing in real time

2. Pain Point / Problem Section

Before/after split-screen or slider design:

Left/"Before" side: the chaotic, no-visibility sales process (dark tones, cluttered, red accents) — deals going dark, no shared understanding of next steps, managers flying blind on deal progress
Right/"After" side: the MAP-enabled process (clean, bright green, organized) — full alignment, shared accountability, clear pipeline visibility


Animate on scroll or let the user drag a divider. Keep copy short, punchy, and emotionally resonant.

3. Key Metrics / Social Proof Strip

Display 3 key stats with animated scrollytelling counters that count up as they enter the viewport:

X% average increase in deal velocity
X% improvement in close rates
Greater stickiness — more touchpoints, better visibility, and continuous buyer-seller communication


Use placeholder "X%" values to fill in later. Style as large, eye-catching numbers with brief descriptors. Pair with a subtle background visual like a pipeline funnel filling or a deal timeline accelerating.

4. How It Works

Scroll-triggered reveal where each step structurally assembles as the user scrolls — timeline nodes connecting with animated lines, elements building in sequence:

Create — Build a shared action plan with your prospect in seconds
Collaborate — Both sides see tasks, timelines, and owners in real time
Close — Track progress, remove blockers, and accelerate the deal to close


Use asymmetric layout with staggered card entrances, NOT a standard centered 3-step layout

5. Features Section

Tabbed or interactive showcase — clicking/hovering each feature morphs a central mockup to show that feature in context. Or a scroll-jacked feature spotlight where each feature gets its own mini-scene:

Shared deal timelines with real-time status
Task ownership and accountability tracking
Automated nudges and reminders
Stakeholder mapping (know every decision-maker)
Activity feed and engagement analytics
Manager dashboard for pipeline visibility



6. Integrations Section

"Works with the tools you already use"
Display HubSpot, Salesforce, and Slack logos as an animated ecosystem diagram — orbiting or connected via animated node lines on glassmorphic floating cards with subtle depth and hover parallax
Brief copy about seamless CRM sync, Slack notifications, and no workflow disruption

7. Testimonial / Social Proof Section

Oversized pull-quote design with large serif typography
Slow auto-rotating carousel with frosted glass background and subtle ken-burns movement
Placeholder for 2–3 customer quotes from sales leaders (name, title, company — placeholders fine)

8. Final CTA Section

Strong closing headline (e.g., "Stop Losing Deals to Confusion" or "Your Buyers Want Clarity — Give It to Them")
Repeat the primary CTA with an email capture field or "Book a Demo" button
Optional urgency element: "Join the early access waitlist" or "Limited beta spots available"

9. Footer

Standard footer with nav links, social icons, legal links
Minimal and clean


Technical Notes

Use smooth, performant CSS animations (prefer CSS transitions and IntersectionObserver over heavy JS animation libraries)
Ensure accessibility basics: proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
Placeholder images and logos are fine — use clean SVG icons or simple shapes where needed
All animations must run at 60fps on mobile devices
